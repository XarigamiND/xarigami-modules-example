/**
 * Standard function to Delete an item
 *
 * This is a standard function that is called whenever an administrator
 * wishes to delete a current module item. Note that this function is
 * the equivalent of both of the modify() and update() functions above as
 * it both creates a form and processes its output. This is fine for
 * simpler functions, but for more complex operations such as creation and
 * modification it is generally easier to separate them into separate
 * functions. There is no requirement in the Xaraya MDG to do one or the
 * other, so either or both can be used as seen appropriate by the module
 * developer
 *
 * @author Example Module Development Team
 * @param  int    $args['exid']    the id of the item to be deleted
 * @param  string $args['confirm'] confirm that this item can be deleted
 */
