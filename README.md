# Xarigami Example Module

Example module is currently responsible for accomplishing two main tasks:

* Providing a simple module template with standard functions, blocks, hooks,
Dynamic Data properties, and templates that Developers can use as a basis for a new module.
* Providing documentation in the functions and template files for those 
that wish to learn about standard Xaraya Module development.

The Example module demonstrates:

* Examples of standard Xaraya functions commented in plain terms, and written with Xaraya coding standards.
* Templates with standard style classes, layouts and template requirements to meet Xaraya Block Layout coding standards.
* Examples of hooks, blocks, dynamic data properties, and event handlers.
* A simple demonstration on how to use xmlhttp requests (aka 'ajax'). 
The admin interface uses xml http requests to build up the editing and 
deletion interface. For more detailed info, look in the templates 
(e.g. xartemplates/includes/admin-menu.xd) in this module.
